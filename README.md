# Follow discord TOS
Just follow Discord TOS ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Don't post malicious links, files, scripts, websites, etc...
Don’t send any sort of file, link, malware, spyware, etc… that may harm or danger a user in any way.

# DO NOT ADVERTISE IN THE SERVER OR DM’S

Don't DM advertise to members or staff of the server things such as discord servers, scam links and anything deemed an advertisement unless is aloud within reason/channels topics. Although we understand you're proud of your creation, and want to show it off to everybody! It's seriously awesome that you do that, but advertising your stuff too much can make other user's chat experience worse, and degraded.

# DO NOT USE ANY LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH UNLESS IN PROPERLY MODERATED CHANNELS

Don’t use any other language other than English in this server. Using foreign languages may result in a ban, warning, or timeout depending on the severity, this is because our mods are primarily English and cannot moderate outside that region. Although we do have staff members and members who speak other languages(Such as French, Chinese, Romanian, etc…) we prefer you keep it english for the satisfaction and better experience of others.

# DONT USE SWEAR WORDS OR INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE EXCESSIVELY

Don’t use swear words or inappropriate language excessively. It is aloud but not in large abundance, you may also when you use it when you are casually talking such as “yeah it was fucking crazy XD”. A reminder as well hate speech and slurs are strictly prohibited and will result in an immediate ban.

# DONT CONDUCT ANY SORT IF HATE SPEACH OR DISCRIMINATIVE LANGUAGE

In zero case should you be using any sort of hate speech or harassing members religion, sexuality, race, etc… This is a zero tolerance rule and will result in an instant weeks timeout or permanent ban. Please DM a staff member if you are being harassed and it has not been dealt with correctly or at all. We are inclusive here and will deal with all forms of harassment properly.

# DONT IMPERSONATE OR PRETEND TO BE PEOPLE OTHER THAN YOURSELF

Do not pretend or imitate others in the server or globally (such as famous figures and influences like **Indieun** etc…). You may do this if you have explicit permission from a figure to do so but the offence must be minor and not be deceiving or con others into believing false identities. Having the same name or simply a PFP of said person does however not class as impersination

# DO NOT HAVE UN-PINGABLE OR INAPPROPRIATE NAMES AND PROFILE PICTURES, SPAM CHANNELS, BE TOXIC

Do not make or do thing that make the server harder for our staff and members to use such as:
1.Unpingable or inappropriate names
2. Inappropriate PFP's
3. Spam channels, threads, forums, etc…
4. Be toxic to other members

*Just treat members with respect, kindness, and have a good time don't just go about ruining it for others, for your entertainment. Everyone asking for support and playing the game is one user one step closer to reaching their goals. While dumb questions are "dumb" in some people's opinions, other people can't understand, so instead they ask us to help. Don't be rude to somebody and say "the solution is right in your face" and instead walk them trough the issue and help them solve it. A nice friendly environment is always welcoming!*

# DO NOT SELL/SCAM OR BUY ANYTHING FOR REAL MONEY WITHOUT PROPER MODERATION

Do not sell unauthorised products or services without explicit permission from higher staff. You may advertise your product or service however in relevant channels that accept it such as #creations but in any other case please do not!

# ABSOLUTELY ANY USE OF AI IS FORBIDDEN
Using AI to rewrite text which has facts or information is forbidden along with AI generated content such as music, images, text, etc...

# BE MATURE

# DO NOT CAUSE ANY CHAT DISTURBANCES

# USE SUPPORT CORRECTLY AND CHECK BEFORE YOU ASK!

Support team members are real humans as well, and they can read your question if you ping them once or twice. While it is really frustrating to have a problem you can't really solve all by yourself, please do not frustrate others by repeatedly asking the same question over and over every 5-10 minutes, or questions that have already been answered a lot. Taking a break (of around 30 minutes) would help a lot. If your problem is not getting the support it needs, you can always ask an expert. (The awesome guys with yellow names and the badge) for support.
- While support should usually be granted, it's not guaranteed! We can't always fix an issue you have. It might be a bug, it might be an user error, or might aswell be random! Sometimes we can't figure some things out, and you've got to understand that support staff are human as well!
- If your support post hasn't been answered for 12 hours after it's been opened, please don't hesitate contact a staff member (Awesome guys with blue names!) . But truly understand that you've got to wait before calling one, heh!


*That's literally all users, thanks for taking your time to read our guidlines.*

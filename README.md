An example rule set for managing a Discord server.

Ban and Warning Guide
	•	Breaking a rule typically results in a warning or a timeout.
	•	Staff reserve the right to issue timeouts or bans at their discretion.
	•	Accumulating 6 warnings within 2 months, or receiving the same warning multiple times, may result in a ban.
	•	Receiving 15+ timeouts within a week may result in a ban or an extended timeout.
	•	Major or repeated offenses may lead to a full ban or suspension from specific channels (e.g., #media).

General Rules

1. Follow Discord’s Terms of Service

Just follow Discord’s Terms of Service — simple as that ¯\(ツ)/¯

2. No Malicious Content

Do not post any harmful files, links, scripts, websites, or anything that could endanger other users.

3. No Advertising (Server-Wide and DMs)

Advertising through the server or direct messaging other members/staff is not allowed unless explicitly permitted in designated channels.
We understand you’re proud of your creations — and that’s awesome! — but excessive advertising can ruin the experience for others.

4. English Only (Unless Otherwise Stated)

Please only use English in public channels unless specified otherwise.
This ensures moderation is effective and the experience remains consistent for everyone.
(We do have staff and members who speak other languages, but English keeps it simple.)

5. Avoid Excessive Swearing and Inappropriate Language

Swearing is allowed in casual conversation (e.g., “Yeah, it was fucking crazy XD”), but keep it moderate.
	•	Hate speech, slurs, and discriminatory language are strictly prohibited and will result in an immediate ban.

6. Absolutely No Hate Speech or Discrimination

There is zero tolerance for hate speech or harassment based on religion, sexuality, race, or any other personal characteristic.
	•	Immediate action will be taken, including permanent bans.
	•	If you are harassed, DM a staff member immediately — we take it seriously.

7. No Impersonation

Do not impersonate other users, celebrities, or staff members.
	•	Parody accounts are allowed only with explicit permission and must not be misleading.

8. Keep Usernames and Avatars Appropriate

Do not use:
	•	Inappropriate or offensive usernames or profile pictures
	•	Names that cannot be pinged/tagged easily
	•	Spam in channels, threads, or forums
	•	Toxic behavior toward others

Respect everyone. Help create a welcoming, helpful community. “Dumb questions” don’t exist — guide others kindly.

9. No Unauthorized Selling, Buying, or Scamming

Do not buy, sell, or trade real-world products or services without prior approval from server staff.
	•	Some channels (like #creations) may allow promotions if relevant.

10. No Use of AI-Generated Content
	•	Do not use AI to create or rewrite factual or informational content.
	•	AI-generated music, images, or text are also not permitted.

11. Be Mature and Respectful

Act responsibly and maturely at all times. Treat others the way you’d want to be treated.

12. No Chat Disturbances

Do not intentionally disrupt conversations or flood chats with spam, random off-topic messages, or trolling.

13. Use Support Channels Correctly
	•	Only ping support staff once or twice — not repeatedly.
	•	Please check FAQs or pinned messages before asking for help.
	•	Support is not guaranteed. Some issues may be outside our control (bugs, user error, etc.).
	•	If you do not receive help within 12 hours, you may DM a staff member with a blue name.
